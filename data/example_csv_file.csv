title,Drone-based mapping of the Lagoon Pingo in Svalbard,,,,,
summary,"This database contains a digital elevation model (DEM) and an orthomosaic map of the Lagoon Pingo in Svalbard. The DEM and orthomosaic were built from drone-based images and a structure from motion (SfM) method with Agisoft Metashape. The Lagoon Pingo is a coastal open-system pingo with year-round methane release located in the High Arctic fjord-valley of Adventdalen, Svalbard. This dataset depicts Lagoon Pingo in May 2020 at the end of the Spring season, whereby surface icings have developed following freezing of the perennial groundwater springs. The data was collected with a DJI Mavic 2 Pro and a Hasselblad L1D-20c optical sensor. This dataset has been originally published on DataverseNO via https://doi.org/10.18710/IMPEG8, this dataset is a netCDF version with the same data. ",,,,,

keywords_vocabulary,GCMD Science Keywords, Norway. There are three locations, Larsbreen, Longyearbreen, and Tellbreen. The dataset was generated using a structure-from-motion (SfM) method using drone-based imagery. The data was processed with Agisoft Metashape (version 1.8.5) and the processed data consists of digital elevation models (DEMs) in georeferenced .TIF file format and orthomosaic maps in georeferenced .JPG or .TIF. In addition, a process report in archived .PDF file format is included for each dataset. Mapping was conducted with a DJI Mavic 2 Pro Enterprise. The fieldwork was conducted in September 2022 on Tellbreen by Eero Rinne and October on Larsbreen and Longyearbreen by Richard Hann.
